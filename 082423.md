GATA6 + TET DNA methylatin

GATA4 also could recruit TET

GGAA repeats EWS-FLI1 binding sites

Ewing EWS-FLI1 scaoma cells
Riggi et al 2014 model

Highly connected 3D chromatin networks, each anchor can binds a lot of peaks

24 hrs the KD is completed, within 96 hrs all the indirect effect happenes

more motif does always means great, 4->16~20 is best, black people has more repeats but they are protected

interacting between domains, but the domain boundaries did not change

TCR enhancers activities also drop after 3 or 4

YY1 showne by rick young is a structure protein, search to see if yy1 is in the paper

can it over come the CTCF insulators to active genes

go biological process
